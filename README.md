# Challenge Project: Build Your Own Cheat Sheet
This is my solution to the Off-Platform Project: Build Your Own Cheat Sheet that can be found within the Front-End Engineer career path from [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/).

## What I Learned
While working on this project, I revisited what I learned throughout the course. In particular:
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3 like Flexbox

## Continued Development
I will continue to revisit semantic HTML because I think it is important to structure future websites in such a way that they are accessible to all that visit the websites I create. That is what I want to continue to work on.

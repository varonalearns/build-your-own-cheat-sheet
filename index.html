        <h1>This h1 element is inside a main element because it is the main header of the main content on this page. It is in a blue box.</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Semantic HTML? Never heard of her.</h2>
            <p>Yet, semantic HTML makes a page more readable and accessible. Try not to use div when something more semantic might work. Like section or article or simply p. This h2 element and p element are in a section element that is in the main element. There are steps here, alright?</p>
            <p>Section element has a background color of green. Cool stuff.</p>

    <footer>
        <p>Footer stuff goes here. Navigation that did not fit in the header.</p>
